- write inclusion validations for dropdowns
- add profile/detail uniqueness constraints
- add age min
- ask if you broke MVC with looking_for
- ask about proper place to store constants
- add flash
- fix routes
- figure out the irrelevant question issue (write a validation and remove irrelevant?)

## always use rails helpers for img, JS, CSS

- figure out a way to not constantly hammer the db via current_user
- collect and fix before_filters for proper users

Features:
- Anything location-based
- Questions
- Matching
- Photos
- New message notification (read messages?)

Responses:
- Show question title
- Show their response, your response
- Make a response new


Actual Backbone layout:

Match algo in ActiveRecord:

# iterate over this to reduce db querying? maybe?
common_questions = me.answered_questions & you.answered_questions


next unless you.answered_questions.include?(my_response.question)
if my_response.ok_responses.ok_answers.include?(your_response.answer)
  numerator += my_response.importance
end
denominator += my_response.importance

Need matchbox on:
- User show
- matches
