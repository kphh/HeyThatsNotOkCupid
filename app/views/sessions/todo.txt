- add profile/detail uniqueness constraints

- ask if you broke MVC with looking_for
- ask about proper place to store constants
- add flash
  - style flash
- figure out the irrelevant question issue (write a validation and remove irrelevant?)
- deletion
- restructure w/ routes for different tabs; you don't need to get fancy

## always use rails helpers for img, JS, CSS

- figure out a way to not constantly hammer the db via current_user
- collect and fix before_filters for proper users

Actual Backbone layout:
- Navs all around
- On main page, tabs for About/Photo/Questions


Need matchbox on:
- User show
- matches

ACTUAL TO-DOS:
1. Maps!
2. Stylin'
3. Model tests
4. Sort matches by match%
